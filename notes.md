Dimensionality - Process of reducing the no of input features while preserving as much useful info as possible
 WHY we learn?
1. Curse of Dimensionality
2. Improve model performance
3. Efficiency- computational perfomance
4. Fast Training & Inference
5. Reduces multicollinearity
6. Better Visualizations
